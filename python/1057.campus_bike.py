class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: List[List[int]], bikes: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        distances = []
		# create a list of distances for each worker-bike combination, 
		# put distance in the first tuple element and worker index in second tuple element 
		# and bike index in third. we will sort this list of tuples later.
        for i, worker in enumerate(workers):
            for j, bike in enumerate(bikes):
                distance = abs(worker[0] - bike[0]) + abs(worker[1] - bike[1])
                distances.append((distance, i, j))
				
	    # Sort the tuples
        distances.sort()

        result = [-1] * len(workers)
        bike_taken = set() # Mark a bike as taken by putting it in this set as we traverse the tuples from shortest distance onwards.
        for distance, i, j in distances:
            # print(distance, i, j)
            if result[i] == -1 and j not in bike_taken:
                result[i] = j
                bike_taken.add(j)
        return result

The solution calculates manhattan distance of all possible combinations.
Then it sorts a list of tuples of (distance, worker index and bike index) and uses it to get the final result.
